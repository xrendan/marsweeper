Running the project:
You will need to install sympy and pygame for this program to function properly.
pip3 install pygame
pip3 install sympy
You may require administrative permissions or sudo as per your operating system.
With the dependencies installed call python3 on main.py to access the GUI
Use the settings button to switch between the 3 preset difficulty levels and
switch between player and AI mode. In player mode left click a tile to uncover it,
right click to flag a tile as a mine.
On winning click once to continue.
In AI mode you must select the first square for the AI to play from by clicking.
Clicking after that causes the AI to go through once sequence of attempting to solve
the board. On win or loss click once more to complete the game.

Layout:
board.py contains all code relating to tracking a game of minesweeper, including
storing the board and deciding whether a win or a loss has occurred.
calling board.py directly will cause it to create a large board for stress testing.
It has no interactivity.
Ai.py contains all the code required for the Ai to solve a grid of minesweeper.
It does not include the board class, and instead interfaces using only checkCell and setFlag
as to prevent any cheating. calling Ai.py directly will result in a large test
of the ai on a fixed grid size with variable mines, outputting winrates to the
terminal.
main.py is the main file containing the graphical front end and all user level
game logic. calling it directly starts the game.
the images directory contains the back ground image used in the graphics.
